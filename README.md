# microReviews
microReviews is a product review site where users review the smallest components that make up a product.
All built using the MEAN stack...MongoDB, Express, Angular2, and Node.
Early design of the site will utilize Google's material design and bootstrap.

## The Objective
The objective of the site is for companies, manufacturers, and consumers could have a platform where they can view positive and negative criticism of products manufactured. This will hopefully create a database of information useful to both the consumer and the manufacturer so that we can create better products in the future.

## User stories
I started the website with two user stories. Two examples of how users would utilize the site.

### Theodore the designer
Theodore works for HTC and he is a designer, he is part of the team getting ready to design the next flagship phone. He wants to know what compels people to buy a phone. He knows what HE likes... but he doesn't know what everybody else (the populous) like.

Pamela is looking for a new toaster oven, and there are so many of the m in the market. They all have decent review online so she wants to see if she could start eliminating some options...she is looking to see who did it right, and who did it wrong.
